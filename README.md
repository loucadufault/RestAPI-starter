# API Coding test


You're being given a swagger specification file which describes a micro api.
The goal of the coding challenge is to implement it with the language,
frameworks and database of your choice.

# Notes

* We expect a solution using any tools or libraries you believe are relevant to
  the completion of the tasks;
* We expect you to explain in the deliverable the choices that you made in term
  of tools & design;
* We will pay **a lot of attention** to code quality, maintainability,
  testability and best software engineering practices;
